# Data processing systems
  * Apache Spark
    * The one we are focusing on
  * Apache Mahout
    * Precursor to Spark in some sense
    * Based on Hadoop/MapReduce, but incorporating Spark and H20 algorithms
  * Apache Flink
    * Distributed stream and batch data processing system
    * Currently limited machine learning
    * Keep an eye on this because it might start to take over
    * Real data streaming -- not microbatches as in Spark
    * Also writen in Java and Scala
  * H20
    * Fast scalable machine learning API
    * Hadoop for scalable statistics/ML
  * Sparkling water
    * H20 functionality inside Spark cluster
  * Apache Yarn
    * MapReduce 2.0
# Differences between data processing systems
  * http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28082581/what-is-the-differences-between-apache-spark-and-apache-flink
# Terms
  * SaaS: software as a service (SaaS), applications hosted by a vendor or service provider and made available to customers over a network
  * SPOF: single point of failure: i.e. not fully distributed
  * ETL: extract, transform, load
  * MPP: massively parallel processing
# Cassandra
  * An Apache database for big data
  * ColumnFamily-based (not key-value)
  * Fault-tolerant, decentralized, durable, no SPOF
  * Elastic:  read and write throughput increase linearly with new machines
# PredictionIO
  * Open source machine learning server
# Databricks
  * Cluster manager
  * Interactive analysis environment
  * Production pipelines
  * Third-party apps
# Visual point and click model building
  * Pentaho http://www.pentaho.com/labs
  * Platfora
  * Deepsense http://deepsense.io/
    * open source workflow executor
# Apache Maven
  * Project management and comprehension tool
  * Mostly for Java
